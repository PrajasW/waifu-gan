# Waifu Generator

This project allows you to generate random waifu images using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). You can run the generator in a standard mode or with an enhanced version that uses a Discriminator to verify the generated images before serving them to the user.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** (preferably Python 3.7+)
2. **PyTorch** (with CUDA support if using GPU)
3. **Flask** for serving the web interface
4. **Other Dependencies**: Listed below

### Required Libraries

Before running the code, make sure you install all the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example `requirements.txt`:

```
torch
torchvision
flask
requests
PILLOW
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using the command above.
3. Make sure your trained model weights (`generator.pth` and `discriminator.pth`) are located in the same directory as the Python scripts.

### Project Structure

```
.
├── generator.pth            # Trained Generator model
├── discriminator.pth        # Trained Discriminator model (if using enhanced mode)
├── main.py                  # Standard Generator script (Flask app)
├── enhanced.py              # Enhanced Generator with Discriminator check (Flask app)
├── requirements.txt         # List of required packages
├── static/                  # Static files (images, stylesheets, etc.)
├── templates/               # HTML templates for the UI
│   └── index.html           # Main webpage for generating images
└── README.md                # Project README
```

## Running the Application

### 1. **Normal Generator** (without Discriminator Check)

To run the standard waifu image generator (without a discriminator to verify the generated image), use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start a Flask web server, and you can view the web UI by visiting `http://localhost:5000` in your browser. The app will generate and display random waifu images on each page refresh.

### 2. **Enhanced Generator** (with Discriminator Check)

If you'd like to include a Discriminator to verify the authenticity of generated images, use the following command:

```bash
python enhanced.py
```

In this mode, after generating an image, the Discriminator will evaluate the generated image. If the image passes the check, it will be displayed to the user; otherwise, the generator will try a different combination.

### 3. **Web Interface**

After running either of the scripts, the web UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You will be able to:

- **Generate Random Waifu Images**: Each time you refresh the page, a new random waifu image will be displayed.
- **View the Generated Image**: The image will be shown on the page, and you can refresh to generate a new one.

## Output and Image Storage

Generated images are saved to the `static/images/` folder, and the web UI displays them directly from there. Ensure that the directory exists or the script will create it when running.

1. **Generated Images Location**: 
   - The generated images will be saved to `static/images/` after each generation.
   - You can view them on the web page or manually check the directory.

2. **Access the Images**: 
   - The images are accessible via the web UI and stored in `static/images/`.

### Example Image Generation

After running the app, the URL for the generated image might look like:

```
http://localhost:5000/generate?rand=81629
```

This image will be shown on the web page.

## Kaggle Notebook Reference

For reference on how to train the GAN model used in this project, you can check the Kaggle notebook:

This notebook covers the training process, the architecture used for both the generator and discriminator, and how to save the trained models.
